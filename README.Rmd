The goal of promptimus is to provide a set of R functions to support LLM prompt generation. The package includes simple functions for popular prompt generation frameworks such as RTF (role, task, format), Chain of Thought, Fewshot, and Prompt Chaining.

## Installation

You can install the development version of promptimus from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("parmsam/promptimus")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(promptimus)

# Use RTF (role then task then format) framework to generate a prompt
x <- rtf(
  role = "life coach with 30 years of experience in mentoring",   
  task = "plan to improve my work-life balance", 
  format = "table"
)
strwrap(x, width = 80)
# Use Chain of Thought framework to generate a prompt
x <- chain_of_thought(
  instructions = "How do I improve my sales calls? I've only got a 15% close rate right now, and I think it's because I'm not selling the dream enough."
)
strwrap(x, width = 80)
```
